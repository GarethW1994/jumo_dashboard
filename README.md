<p>The data gathered will be from Jumos customer base. This will allow for information to be passed for graphical representation. We will be catagorising expendatures based on a supply and demand chain map that shows the most grown product in a particular location. These catagories will be given 1 of 3 colour ratings as well as an emoticon. THey will then be summarised in a temperature graph. Information will be filtered by location and product supply in and around that location.</p>
